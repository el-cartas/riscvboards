This site tries to be a place where people can find **Risc-v** boards
reviews, news, projects, a database containing every single SBC[^1] (and
more desktop type boards too) released, and much more. 

Everything in here is a work in progress. I plan to add much more in the
future, stay tuned!

TODO:
